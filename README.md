                # Get the column where the user clicked
                col = event.pos[0] // CELL_SIZE
                if drop_piece(col):
                    if check_win():

Programming Ideas: In order to develop the game of Connect 4, I will need to use a number of programming ideas, such as:
• Arrays: I'll use arrays to store the playing field and track the pieces that each player has used.
• Loops: In order to iterate around the game board, check for winning criteria, and provide players the opportunity to take turns, I will utilize loops.
• Conditional Statements: To check for winning criteria and decide whether the game is ended, I will use conditional statements.
• Event Handling: I'll use event handling to track when a player clicks a column to drop a piece, updating the game board as a result.
• Graphical User Interface (GUI): To build the game's graphical user interface and enable user interaction, I'll utilize a GUI framework like Pygame.

Follow these steps to play Connect 4:
1. Get Python (version 3.6 or higher) from https://www.python.org/downloads/ and install it.
2. Download the ZIP file or clone the repository.
3. Utilize the terminal or command prompt to navigate to the project directory.
4. To install the Pygame library, issue the command "pip install pygame".
5. To launch the game, use "python connect4.py" at the command line.
6. A blank Connect 4 board will appear in the game window when it opens.
7. To drop a component, click a column.
8. Each player takes a turn putting one of their colored discs into a column.
9. Play continues until one player connects four discs in a row to win, or the board fills up and the game is declared a draw.
10. Press the 'r' key to restart the game. Press the 'q' key to end the game.

Other notes:
• We had to experiment with various approaches to get Pygame's event handling to function properly after running into some problems.
• Using Python's built-in "pickle" module, we created a feature that allows game states to be saved and loaded. The game board, the current player, and the score are all part of the recorded data.
• We created tags for each significant release of our code using Git to version control it.
• Using Pyinstaller, we made a standalone executable for the game and tested it on both Windows and Mac OS.
